## üêõ KNOWN ISSUES

### 1. Google Maps API Key Required
- Map-based service zones require Google Maps API key
- Graceful fallback with instructions if not configured
- Add `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` to environment

### 2. Mock Data
- All document/notary/client data is still mock data
- Backend integration still required
- localStorage used for authentication (temporary)

### 3. Mobile Responsiveness
- Map component needs mobile optimization
- Touch gestures for map drawing not fully tested

---

## üí° RECOMMENDATIONS

### Short Term
1. **Provide missing specifications** (upload UI, client dashboard, digital signatures)
2. **Decide on language approach** (toggle vs. full Spanish)
3. **Set up Google Maps API** for service zone testing
4. **Review and approve current changes**

### Medium Term
1. Implement backend API integration
2. Replace localStorage auth with JWT
3. Add real-time notifications
4. Implement digital signature workflow

### Long Term
1. Mobile app (React Native)
2. Advanced analytics for admins
3. Automated notary verification with government databases
4. Blockchain integration for document certification
